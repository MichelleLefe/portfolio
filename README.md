# Portfolio website

**This website showcases creating a web application from the ground up **

### The first day I did an intial setup 9/28/2020:

*added the file structure for the application. react-client/src is what hosts the components for the frontend.
*server/index.js has the basic express endpoints to use later
*installed babel 7 and webpack.
*configured the webpack.config.js file
*added scripts for ease of use.
